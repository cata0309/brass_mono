A free retro monospaced font inspired by 70's electrical and mechanical design. It's open source, a solid choice for writing code, and pairs well with [shellectric colors](https://github.com/fonsecapeter/shellectric-color-scheme).

### Development
from the root dir,
  * first run `make init` to set up the dependencies
  * edit the svg font and save
  * run `make build` to build and zip the fonts with fontforge
  * run `make install` to install the fonts to your user account (will update if already installed in ~/.fonts/BrassMonoFonts)
